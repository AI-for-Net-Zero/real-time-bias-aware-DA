%The bias in the mean pressure can be due to large scale flow structures which are not
correlated to the thermoacoustic dynamics.

%The parameter which is of most intesrest for real time inference perspective is
definitely the linear growth rate, because it gives the “strength” of the instability,
i.e. how fast is the system repelled from the origin if it would be forced to start from
it. Knowing this strength tells you how difficult it would be to stabilize the system.
The stabilization can be achieved for instance by allocating space to acoustic dampers,
but the damping volume needed will be directly linked to the linear growth
rate (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2018.12.011).

%It is one of the best papers I’ve co-authored, and also one of the longest to get
published (probably 2.5 years, JFM was the 4th journal where we’ve submitted it). Although
the main results were ready from the beginning, the last improvements allowed us to also
replicate a more subtle feature of the dynamics, the intermittent changes of preferred
standing wave component direction, governed by these 2 parameters. But after having modeled
this effect, we decided to simply adjust by hand these parameters and make use of the
identification of the other parameters already made earlier. It may be that the optimum
set of parameters vary a bit when all of them are identified at the same time (you’ll
tell me what you get).

%Somehow same reason as 3: our very first submission was at the same time as the submission
of [1] and over the course of the iterations, the paper improved (we made identification for
a larger set of equivalence ratio) and the identified paramteres slightly changed. But overal
these small relative changes are not relevant given the nature of the problem at hand (see
figure 9 of [2]).
