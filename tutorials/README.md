# Tutorials 
This folder includes a collection of jupyter notebooks to ease the introduction to this repository.



## Getting started
1. Install the requirements of the main repository [here](https://github.com/andreanovoa/real-time-bias-aware-DA/blob/main/requirements.txt).
2. Also install the additional requirements for the tutorials [here](https://github.com/andreanovoa/real-time-bias-aware-DA/blob/main/tutorials/requirements.txt).

## Where to start?
Each tutorial file name includes a two-digit code, which indicates the tutorial category.
